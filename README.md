# gettingToStanfordMSCS
This repo will track my progress as an applicant for the master in computer science. I'll create a plan and set goals to stand out as a candidate. This can also help others interested in applying to stanford. In addition, even though I want to apply to stanford the achievements through this plan/tracker can help me to apply at other institutions.
